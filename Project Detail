## 💻 How It Works

1. Enter a task in the input field.
2. Click **Add Task** or press **Enter**.
3. Manage tasks using:
   - Checkbox → mark complete
   - Edit icon → update task
   - Delete icon → remove task
4. Filter tasks using:
   - All
   - Active
   - Completed
5. Search tasks using the search bar.
6. Completed tasks can be cleared using **Clear Completed Tasks**.

All tasks are stored in **local storage**, so data remains even after refreshing the page.
